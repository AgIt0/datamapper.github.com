      <h1>The Great Refactoring</h1>
<p>&#8220;Tip&#8221; DataMapper (hosted on <a href="http://github.com/datamapper/dm-core">github</a>) is going through a dramatic re-factor.  Here&#8217;s a quick summary of the anticipated NEW public API.</p>
<h2>Not Just for Databases Anymore</h2>
<p>DataMapper&#8217;s class terminology will change and &#8216;de-couple&#8217; itself from database-specific terminology.  Gone are &#8220;database&#8221;, &#8220;table&#8221;, &#8220;column&#8221; and &#8220;join&#8221;.  Say hello to &#8220;Repository&#8221;, &#8220;Resource&#8221;, &#8220;Property&#8221;, and &#8220;Link&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would you want to do that?&#8221;, you ask. Ultimately it&#8217;s because DataMapper will soon support different types of persistence layers, not just databases.  It&#8217;ll talk to all sorts of things like web services (REST and such), XML files, YAML files, non-relational databases, even custom file-types or services of your own design.  Just implement an Adapter that conforms to a certain API and DataMapper could support any type of data store.  No need for a completely separate library or anything.</p>
<p>As an added benefit, DataMapper become more &#8220;RESTful&#8221;. <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/rest-to-my-wife">Ryan Tomayko</a> has a very good explanation of REST that all should read entitled <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/rest-to-my-wife">How I Explained REST to My Wife</a>.</p>
<h2>Model Definitions Are a Little Different</h2>
<p>Since we&#8217;re changing up the terminology, model definitions are going to change up a little bit.  Here&#8217;s what a Planet model would look like using the new API:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
<pre><span class="no"> 1</span> <span class="r">class</span> <span class="cl">Planet</span>
<span class="no"> 2</span>   include <span class="co">DataMapper</span>::<span class="co">Resource</span>
<span class="no"> 3</span> 
<span class="no"> 4</span>   resource_names[<span class="sy">:legacy</span>] = <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">dying_planets</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>
<span class="no"> 5</span> 
<span class="no"> 6</span>   property <span class="sy">:name</span>, <span class="co">String</span>
<span class="no"> 7</span>   property <span class="sy">:age</span>,  <span class="co">Integer</span>
<span class="no"> 8</span>   property <span class="sy">:core</span>, <span class="co">String</span>,  <span class="sy">:private</span> =&gt; <span class="pc">true</span>
<span class="no"> 9</span> <span class="r">end</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>A couple of things are going on here.  First, DataMapper::Base and DataMapper::Persistence are gone and replaced with <a href="http://datamapper.rubyforge.org/DataMapper/Resource.html">DataMapper::Resource</a>.  Next <code>set_table_name</code> has been replaced with <code>resource_names</code> hash where you specify which arena play occurs in. After that we have a couple of Property definitions that look a little different.</p>
<p>First off, Properties will no longer take <code>:symbols</code> for their types and instead take real constants like String, Integer, DateTime.  Also on the docket are the ability to define your own custom types.</p>
<p>Think about that for a minute.  If developers are able to define their own custom types with their own materialization and serialization methods, DataMapper will be able to support all kinds of wild data-types like GIS information, network information, marshaled objects, JSON&#8230;pretty much anything a developer might need, or want.</p>
<h2>A Command-Line Interface</h2>
<p>Taking a lesson from web frameworks, DataMapper will sport an interactive command-line so that you can browse your resources without the need to load up the entire environment of your application.  Here&#8217;s an example session:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
<pre><span class="no">1</span> $ dm mysql://root@localhost/great_musicians # connecting to a repository
</pre>
</div>
<p>An IRB session boots up&#8230;</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
<pre>&gt;&gt; the_king = <span class="co">Person</span>.first(<span class="sy">:name</span> =&gt; <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">elvis</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>)
&gt;&gt; the_king.alive? <span class="c"># =&gt; maybe</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>This is very similar to <code>script/console</code> in Rails or <code>merb -i</code> in Merb, only it won&#8217;t load up the entire environment of your application, just your DataMapper resources and their associations, methods, and such.  If you prefer &#8220;fat models&#8221;, this will constitute the core of your application.</p>
<h2>How This All Comes Together</h2>
<p>This is the coolest new feature of DataMapper: we&#8217;re skipping all the way from 0.3.0 to 0.9! Get excited, contact the press, fire up the blogosphere!  Its a huge jump and we&#8217;re honestly concerned that people may not be able to handle it.</p>
<p>Alright, so it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> big of a deal, but we&#8217;re confident that all of this will get DataMapper so close to going 1.0 that we&#8217;ll be able to taste it.  To get there, DataMapper&#8217;s more advanced features like single table inheritance, paranoia, and chained associations will be re-implimented to use all this new stuff, and then we&#8217;re sure 0.9 will need a touch up or two.</p>
<p>So close&#8230;.so very very close&#8230;</p>
