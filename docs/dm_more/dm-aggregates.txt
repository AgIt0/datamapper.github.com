DM-Aggregates provides a reporting API which offers aggregating functions like @count@, @min@, @max@, @avg@, @sum@, and @aggregate@.

h3. Setup

Simply @require 'dm-aggregates'@ somewhere before you connect to your data-store and you're ready to go.

h3. Count

You can issue a totaling query with DM-Aggregates in a couple of ways.  First, you can build a totaling query off of your Resource:

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby") do -%>
  Dragon.count(:homes_destroyed.lte => 12)
<% end %>

Secondly, you can call @count@ off of a pre-build query object.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby") do -%>
  Dragon.all(:age.lte => 3).count
<% end %>

Your query will become a totaling query without having to retrieve the objects and total on the retrieved array.    These two approaches can be combined as well.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby") do -%>
  Dragon.all(:homes_destroyed.lte => 12).count(:rating => 'amateur')
<% end %>

h3. Min, Max

Minimum and Maximum values from fields in your data-store can be retrieved by specifying which property you want to retrieve the value from.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby") do -%>
  Dragon.min(:homes_destroyed)
  Dragon.max(:homes_destroyed)
<% end %>

Further conditions to your min and max queries are simply supplied after the property.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby") do -%>
  Dragon.min(:homes_destroyed, :battles_won.gte => 20)
  Dragon.max(:homes_destroyed, :title.not => nil, :nickname.like => "%puff%")
<% end %>

h3. Sum, Average

Both @sum@, and @avg@ work very similarly to @min@ and @max@.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby") do -%>
  Dragon.sum(:toes_on_claw)
  Dragon.sum(:toes_on_claw, :is_fire_breathing => true)

  Dragon.avg(:toes_on_claw)
  Dragon.avg(:toes_on_claw, :is_fire_breathing => true)
<% end %>

h3. Aggregate

The @aggregate@ method will let you combine all of the other aggregating methods together to retrieve in one call to the data-store.  DM-Aggregates adds in a few extra symbol operators in order to enable this.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby") do -%>
  Dragon.aggregate(:all.count, :name.count, :toes_on_claw.min,
    :toes_on_claw.max, :toes_on_claw.avg, :toes_on_claw.sum,
    :is_fire_breathing)
  # [
  #   [ 1, 1, 3, 3, 3.0, 3, false ],
  #   [ 2, 1, 4, 5, 4.5, 9, true ]
  # ]
<% end %>

This will compile all of the aggregating queries together and return them in an array of arrays.
