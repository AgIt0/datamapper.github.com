h1. Development

DataMapper development has switched to the "Git":http://git.or.cz SCM. Please see "using git":/using-git.html to learn how to contribute.  To check out "tip" DataMapper anonymously:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
git clone git://github.com/sam/dm-core.git
<% end %>

If you have a "github":http://www.github.com account, log in, and _fork_ "Sam's Repo":http://github.com/sam/dm-core/tree/master.  When you think you're ready, send Sam a "pull request".

h2. Coding Conventions and Considerations

When contributing any code to DataMapper, please follow these guidelines.

# Spec first. Spec thoroughly. (DataMapper is written with "Rspec":http://rspec.info/)
# Parentheses around parameter lists for methods
# Two space indent - not tabs!
# Documentation is required (use the "official documentation style":/docs/)

Consider following the "code optimization tips":http://wiki.datamapper.org/doku.php?id=codeoptimizationtips page on the wiki.

h2. Running the Benchmarks

DataMapper is built for speed and comes with a benchmarking suite to help us keep it that way.  In order to run the suite, make sure you have the following things installed:

* data_objects 0.9.0
* do_mysql 0.9.0
* faker
* active_record (for comparison)

You'll then need a @data_mapper_1@ and @data_mapper_2@ database setup in your MySQL and Postgres installations and accessible via your DB's @root@ user. For more connection information and settings, crack open @script/performance.rb@.

DataMapper will auto-migrate the databases into the proper state for benchmarking and then generate 10,000 rows to play with.

Then, simply:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
script/performance.rb
<% end %>

The most recent official performance ratings can be found in PERFORMANCE.
