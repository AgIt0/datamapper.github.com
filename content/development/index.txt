h1. Development

DataMapper development has switched to the "Git":http://git.or.cz SCM. Please see "using git":/using-git.html to learn how to contribute.  To check out "tip" DataMapper anonymously:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
git clone git://github.com/sam/extlib.git
git clone git://github.com/sam/dm-core.git
git clone git://github.com/sam/dm-more.git
<% end %>

Or visit the "edge guide":/articles/stunningly_easy_way_to_live_on_the_edge.html.

If you have a "github":http://www.github.com account, log in, and _fork_ "Sam's Repo":http://github.com/sam/dm-core/tree/master.  When you think you're ready, send Sam a "pull request".

h2. Coding Conventions and Considerations

When contributing any code to DataMapper, please follow these guidelines.

# Spec first. Spec thoroughly. (DataMapper is written with "Rspec":http://rspec.info/)
# Parentheses around parameter lists for methods
# Two space indent - not tabs!
# Write optimal code, not magic code
# Documentation is required (use the "official documentation style":/docs/)
