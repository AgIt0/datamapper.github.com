h1. <%= @page.title %>

DataMapper supports callbacks using an "aspect-oriented approach":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_oriented.  You can define callbacks for any method as well as any class method arbitrarily.  

h2. Adding Instance-Level Advice

To declare advice (callback) for a specific method, first define a new method to be run when another is called, then define your point-cut.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
class Post
  include DataMapper::Resource
  
  before :save, :categorize
  
  def categorize
    # ... code here
  end
end
<% end %>

Alternatively, you can declare the advice during the point-cut by supplying a block rather than a symbol representing a method.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
class Post
  include DataMapper::Resource
  
  before :save do
    # ... code here
  end
  
end
<% end %>

h2. Adding Class-Level Advice

To install advice around a class method, use @before_class_method@ or @after_class_method@:

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
class Post
  include DataMapper::Resource

  before_class_method :find, :prepare
  
  def self.prepare
    # ... code here
  end
end
<% end %>

Class level advice does not have access to any resulting instances from the class method, so they might not be the best fit for @after_create@ or @after_save@.


h2. Throw :halt to Stop

You can throw :halt in any callback to stop the chain from continuing. For example if you use a before :destroy callback and throw :halt, the record will not be destroyed. 

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
class Post
  include DataMapper::Resource
  
  # This record will save properly
  before :save do
    # ... code here
  end
  
  # But it will not be destroyed
  before :destroy do
    throw :halt
  end
end
<% end %>
