Development
===========

Contributing to DataMapper might seem a bit intimidating at first. The variety
of available gems and github repositories might appear to be an
impenetrable jungle. Fear not! The available [thor tasks](http://github.com/datamapper/dm-dev)
actually make it really easy to solidly test any kind of patch for DataMapper.

Coding Conventions and Considerations
-------------------------------------

When contributing any code to DataMapper, please follow these guidelines.

* Spec first. Spec thoroughly. (DataMapper is written with [RSpec](http://rspec.info/))
* Parentheses around parameter lists for methods
* Two space indent - not tabs!
* Write optimal code, not magic code
* Documentation is required (use the [official documentation style](/docs/))
