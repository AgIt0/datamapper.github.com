==============

DataMapper is always looking for more contributors. When you've got an itch to
scratch, jump in and contribute! Write a few specs showing us how your code
works, create a patch and [submit it](http://github.com/datamapper/)
as a new ticket or a fix for an existing one. After a few patches and many
thanks, you'll get commit access.

We benchmark all but the most trivial of patches, because we care about
performance and you should too!

What we need
------------

Currently DataMapper needs help in a few particular areas:

* API Documentation (using the [YARD documentation style](http://www.yardoc.org/))
* Tutorials (we think the [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)
  documentation [guidelines](http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/) are a good model)
* Bug Reports (we use [Github Issues](https://github.com/datamapper/dm-core/issues/))
  * **Important**: if you found a bug in a DataMapper project other than
    [dm-core](http://github.com/datamapper/dm-core), please use that
    project's Issue Tracker instead of reporting everything as dm-core
    issues

Git - Edge DataMapper
---------------------

DataMapper development uses [Git](http://git-scm.com/) SCM.
Please see [using git](/using-git.html) to learn how to contribute.
For detailed instructions how to get a proper development setup for
datamapper up and running, have a look at the [edge guide](http://github.com/datamapper/dm-dev).

Code Style Guidelines
---------------------

When contributing any code to DataMapper, please follow these guidelines:

1. Code should match the [style guide](http://github.com/dkubb/styleguide)
2. Specs are required
3. Documentation is required (use the [YARD documentation style](http://www.yardoc.org/))
